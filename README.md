All Windows user please download xampp from [www.xampp.com](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp/) and add all the files to htdocs folder which will be in xampp folder after you download.
This is because the project contains php and needs apache server to be on which is a basic requirement for php to run.
This is my first project which I have made and uploaded so please don't hate me rather tell me about the mistakes made by me, so that I can make my other projects more better.
